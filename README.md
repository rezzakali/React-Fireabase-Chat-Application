Hi there!,
This is a Real-time React Firebase Chat Applicaition which I have created within three days a
and I think this is my one of the best project during my learn React.js in where I used Firebase v9 and v6 of react-router-dom. In this project I tried my best.

In this project the user can create his/her account and logging and he able the change the his/her profile picture and able to create conversation with his/her desire friend .The user can also share the images with them and this is awesome . During this project I am getting the more problems which I solved by googling and youtube and to read the Firebase documentation. In this project I used the following dependencies...

### npm i react-moment / yarn add react-moment
